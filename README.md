# Project title 
Credit_default_prediction_-ML-model- 

## Description
This project uses a dataset of loans provided by kaggle.com to train a classifying machine learning model which makes predictions whether a loan will default or not.
The goal of this project is not to create a model with the best possible accuracy but to demonstrate a general procedure of building a machine learning model and 
conducting an error analysis as a basis of further improvements. 

## Used python libraries
pandas <br>
numpy <br>
